### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ npm run build

```

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
